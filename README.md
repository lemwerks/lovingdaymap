### The expansion of Anti-Miscegination Laws over time

This visualization was built with the help of the great folks at [Code for DC](https://github.com/codefordc) on June 12, 2019. 

So why make this map? It was something of a pet project and idea of mine. To just see this story told on a map. As a mixed kid, I find it fascinating that both of my parents were born in a time when the idea of them having married and had three kids would have been a crime. It's important to me as well to see that changes like this take time and for the user to feel that when interacting, and how the slider takes time to move from 1780 to 1843 to see some changes.
